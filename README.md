# Face-Attendence Application

The "Face-Attendance Application" is a Python project utilizing Scikit-learn's Support Vector Machine for facial recognition. OpenCV, with the Frontln-Harcascade classifier, is employed for accurate face detection. The application automates attendance tracking by processing images or video streams. Pandas and NumPy handle data for efficient record-keeping. This streamlined system enhances accuracy, reducing manual efforts in attendance management.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn (for Support Vector Machine implementation)
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- Frontln-Harcascade (specific Haarcascade classifier for frontal face detection)
- Pandas (data manipulation library)
- NumPy (numerical computation library)
